title: "My Experience"

---

As I started studying computer science late compared to other people, I had to study harder and have a longer time investment. Also at University, I tried to do my assignment as far as I could do. I made phonebook, video rental program, flash memory simulator,.. etc. And I read many kinds of books about AI. As AI requires high coding proficiency and lots of knowledge about math, I studied Math Hard,too. Also I tried to participate AI conference to expand my sight of AI.
