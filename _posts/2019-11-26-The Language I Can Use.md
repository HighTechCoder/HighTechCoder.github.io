title: "My Ability"

---
 My first ability that can be my pros is my good English skill as Korean. Many people who have computer science as their major are not good at English. But as I lived in USA for 2years I can speak English fluently. The computer language I can use is C, C++, and JAVA. I have learned these laguage at university. As AI works based on python, I have plan to learn it.
